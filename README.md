# üêç Python-Futurecoder-Learning
Welcome to my repository! I've been exploring and recalling some of programming languages since during my college years I haven't outsource yet in the field of programming :) This repository contains what I've learned in [Futurecoder](https://www.Futurecoder.io)

- [Introducing Strings](#strings)
- [Introducing Variables](#variables)

## Strings
*Strings* are snippets of text using the single quote ` \
**string** - Sequence of characters \
**character** - single symbol (letter, number, punctuation) \
 
It can also be added together using `+` symbol with the use of `print` method
```python
'hello ' + 'world' #hello world
```
[String.py](/Strings/Strings.py)

## Variables
*Variables* refers to a container of values that can be changed
```python
word = 'Hello'
```
In the [Variables.py](/Variables/Introducing%20Variables.py) file, the 4th line that prints `'word'` will also show the same result, and this is what we call *string literal*.

One of the practices in naming convention in Python is that you use underscore `_` when we have multiple words in a variable.

Programs run in isolation, meaning they don't depend on any previously defined variables. The shells resets and all previous variables are cleared.

```python
word = 'Hello'
name = 'World'
sentence = word + ' ' + name
print(sentence)
word = 'Goodbye'
print(sentence) # Still prints out "Hello World"
```
The variable `sentence` doesn't remember how it was calculated and won't change if the underlying values `word` or `name` are changed.
